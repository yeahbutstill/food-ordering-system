# food-ordering-system

## Run Postgres
```shell
docker run --rm \
--name food-ordering-system-db \
-e POSTGRES_DB=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin \
-e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
-v "$PWD/postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data" \
-p 5432:5432 \
postgres:15
```

## Create schema and Insert Data
```text
- order-service/order-container/src/main/resources/restaurant-schema.sql
- order-service/order-container/src/main/resources/restaurant-data.sql
```

## Run Zookeper
```shell
# goto directory
cd infrastructure/docker-compose
# run
docker compose -f common.yml -f zookeeper.yml up
# to stop
docker compose -f common.yml -f zookeeper.yml down
# open new terminal test
echo ruok | nc localhost 2181
```

## Run Kafka Cluster
```shell
# cd infrastructure/docker-compose
docker compose -f common.yml -f kafka_cluster.yml up
# to stop
docker compose -f common.yml -f kafka_cluster.yml down
# open new terminal and run this for create topic
docker compose -f common.yml -f init_kafka.yml up
```

## Build
```shell
mvn clean install
```

## Let's confirm this by opening the kafka manager user interface
```http request
localhost:9000
```

## Add Cluster
```text
localhost:9000
name cluster: food-ordering-system-cluster
host: zookeeper:2128
```
And save. Now, if I list the clusters, I will see three brokers and a topic created using init-kafka.yml docker compose file

## Check data in topic using kafkacat
```shell
kcat -C -b localhost:19092 -t payment-request
```

##### ingat saat anda menggunakan pemetaan volume, anda harus terlebih dahulu memulai Zookeeper dan kemudian memulai Cluster Kafka, karena kafka cluster memeriksa kesehatan Zookeeper saat startup dan gagal jika tidak sehat

## Note
- The main target of all these architectures is to isolate the domain layer to develop, test, manage and deploy it separately.
- SAGA is used to create long running distributed transactions across services.
- Input ports are implemented in the domain layer but is not the adapter itself, whilst output ports are implemented with secondary adapters, with infrastructure modules.
- DIP(dependency inversion principle) leads to loosely coupled systems and an independent domain layer, by inverting any runtime dependency.
- Aggregate: Group of entities that are logically related. 
- Aggregate root: Root entity to keep the aggregate in a consistent state. 
- Entity: Core domain objects. 
- Value object: Used to bring context to the value. 
- Domain Event: Used to decouple the different domains. It will notify the other domains based on result of business logic.
- Value objects are immutable and only holds data, so identifier is not important for them. That means 2 value objects with same data, but different idâ€™s considered to be the same value object.
- Entity classes do not have to be immutable. In fact they have state changes methods to run during business logic
- Application service should be the first contact point to outside of domain, and it will forward the call to the domain service and entities to complete a business logic.
- TransactionalEventListener is a spring annotation that listens an event that is fired from a transactional method. And it only process the event if the transactional operation is completed successfully.
- Kafka provides a replication factor. It replicates the data on different brokers on different servers. So even if one of the brokers is down, the data will still be available on other nodes.
- KafkaTemplate is a spring component that wraps a Kafka Producer and provides method to easily produce data on kafka. 
- To create a Kafka Consumer with spring, using a KafkaListener annotation on a simple method is enough. 
- If my kafka topic has n partitions, I cannot use more than n threads to consume the data on topics. 
- Kafka Consumer has a max poll records property that limits the number of records returned for a single poll.
- ControllerAdvice: Used to catch exceptions application wide. 
- RestController: Used to create a rest controller with path mapping, and accept type. 
- RequestBody: Used to mark a java class as a request body in the rest request. Spring will map the json body into this class by setting the values automatically. 
- PostMapping: Used to create a method that will serve to a http post request.
- Entities and domain services has the business logic. 
- Domain events should be created in entity or domain services after related business logic is completed. 
- Application services are the first initial contact point to the outside of domain. 
- Domain events should be fired after the related business logic is persisted.
- It is used to create a chain of ACID transactions across services. 
- It is used on distributed environments that multiple services communicate.
- SAGA is difficult to debug as multiple microservices are involved. So it it crucial to have a robust tracing implementations, with trace and span id. 
- As a result of compensating transactions, when user sees a change, in the second look after some time, 
- It is used to add a strong consistency between local acid transactions and event publishing operation. 
- It relies on keeping the domain events in local database to be published later. 
- Two ways to implement publishing part are Pulling the outbox table and CDC(Change Data Capture). 
- It makes SAGA pattern consistent when combined with SAGA.
- CQRS is used to separate write and read parts with eventual consistency
- Pod is the smallest deployable unit. 
- A pod can consist of one or more containers. 
- Services are used to expose deployment through NodePort or Loadbalancer.
